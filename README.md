Currently, the app will automatically not backup if you click on 'backup selected packages' and you didn't click on 'calculate file diffs' *and* the total difference of all the packages being backed up is over 50Mb. In the future this check will be an option and the limit can be changed. To continute with the backup if this happens, just click on 'backup selected packages' again.
